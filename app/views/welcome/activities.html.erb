            <h3> Visit Billings Farm </h3>
            <p class="activity_description">
              Like going on vacation, but hate relaxing? Billings Farm is looking for
              farmhands in the guise of an "educational tour." Build a split rail fence,
              wash laundry the old-fashioned way, sample some farm-made cheese and ice cream,
              or sneak a nibble of hay to see what all the fuss is about. This photo was labelled
              "Baby Sweater Sheep"--gawww. But would it be cute if we wore sweaters made from
              our moms' hair? Probably not.

            <p class="activity_description">
              Find the tallest guest at the wedding, call him Tom until he stops correcting you,
              and climb your way to the top! You'll discover panoramic views of Woodstock,
              if Tom is in Woodstock when you climb him, cause he's at most six-foot-four and he'll
              be squirming a lot.

              In fact, there are many expensive stores in Woodstock. Not sure why
              Farmhouse Pottery got a special shout-out. I bet Betsy has some sort of
              referral deal with them. Hey, speaking of referrals, if you want to try
              a spin class in Cambridge, message me :)
